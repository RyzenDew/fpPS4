{
 vm_object_page_clean

 Clean all dirty pages in the specified range of object.  Leaves page
 on whatever queue it is currently on.   If NOSYNC is set then do not
 write out pages with VPO_NOSYNC set (originally comes from MAP_NOSYNC),
 leaving the object dirty.

 When stuffing pages asynchronously, allow clustering.  XXX we need a
 synchronous clustering mode implementation.

 Odd semantics: if start == end, we clean everything.

 The object must be locked.

 Returns FALSE if some page from the range was not written, as
 reported by the pager, and TRUE otherwise.

{
 vm_object_page_remove:

 For the given object, either frees or invalidates each of the
 specified pages.  In general, a page is freed.  However, if a page is
 wired for any reason other than the existence of a managed, wired
 mapping, then it may be invalidated but not removed from the object.
 Pages are specified by the given range ["start", "end") and the option
 OBJPR_CLEANONLY.  As a special case, if "end" is zero, then the range
 extends from "start" to the end of the object.  If the option
 OBJPR_CLEANONLY is specified, then only the non-dirty pages within the
 specified range are affected.  If the option OBJPR_NOTMAPPED is
 specified, then the pages within the specified range must have no
 mappings.  Otherwise, if this option is not specified, any mappings to
 the specified pages are removed before the pages are freed or
 invalidated.

 In general, this operation should only be performed on objects that
 contain managed pages.  There are, however, two exceptions.  First, it
 is performed on the kernel and kmem objects by vm_map_entry_delete().
 Second, it is used by msync(..., MS_INVALIDATE) to invalidate device-
 backed pages.  In both of these cases, the option OBJPR_CLEANONLY must
 not be specified and the option OBJPR_NOTMAPPED must be specified.

 The object must be locked.

 Function: Coalesces two objects backing up adjoining

 returns TRUE if objects were combined.

 NOTE: Only works at the moment if the second object is NULL -
  if it's not, which object do we lock first?

 Parameters:
  prev_object First object to coalesce
  prev_offset Offset into prev_object
  prev_size Size of reference to prev_object
  next_size Size of reference to the second object
  reserved Indicator that extension region has
    swap accounted for

 Conditions:
 The object must *not* be locked.
